  summary: Signal beacon node to prepare for a committee subnet
  description: |
    After beacon node receives this request:
    - Search using discv5 for peers related to this subnet and replace current peers with those ones if necessary. 
    - Check each provided `slot_signature`, to determine whether any validator has been [assigned the duty of aggregation](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/specs/phase0/validator.md#aggregation-selection)
    based on their slot signature.

    "200":
      description: |
        Slot signature is valid and beacon node has prepared the attestation subnet.

        If any of the returned results for aggregation selection return `true`, the beacon client will begin
        preparing an aggregation that the validator client must ask for 
        and sign at the appropriate time.
